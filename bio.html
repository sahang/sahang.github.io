	<h1> ME, MYSELF AND I.</h1>
	
	<p> <h4> 
	<p> <h4> It's a simple story of a boy name Sahan Gayanaka, who currently studies at Edulink International Campus. 
			I spent thirteen years at Lyceum International School and graduated from there in the year 2015. </p>
	<p> So I started my foundation on January in the year 2016 and was graduated from foundation and went into to do the degree. 
		So now comes the biggest challenge of completing the three year degree and going up to graduate with a best possible results I can.
		The final and the ultimate goal of me would be that. </p>
	<p> From the days back in school, I liked Information Technology and I always wanted to explore more about what is happening 
		in the developing world. So doing this degree might help me learn more things about what's happening now and then. </p>
	<p> My passion was playing cricket. The place didn't really matter if there are awesome people around you who likes to play. 
		I had the priviledge to captain my school team where we reached the runners up in the international schools tournament.
		Never felt happy than reaching the finals as a captain. And i know i can always work with a team and no matter what, they
		will back me up at anytime. </p> 
	<p> So if you see me somewhere, don't forget to say 'Hey' and come talk to me. And don't forget to watch the video below. That's one 
		happy moment in my life. CHEERS!!!! </h4> <p>
